- What are your initial impressions of Java?
Java requires you to list the attributes of everything a lot more when declaring them.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
There are certain basic functionalities like loops and capitalization for which syntax might be different but the concepts are the same.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked: Not being afraid to get started because I actually know more than I think I do, and also just playing around with writing "draft" lines that I knew wouldn't work but got me closer to figuring out how to *make* it work.
What didn't: Java syntax is annoying and different from Python and hard.
Advice: GO TO TUTORING HOURS and also ChatGpt is useful for looking up concepts (don't use it to copy paste code tho).
